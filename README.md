# Summary

This is a transcription of the book "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu into Fortune F
ile format.

# How to Use
On Fedora linux, the fortune utility is located in the package `fortune-mod`.

Once installed, quotes will be generated by running the `fortune` command.

# How to Install
To install this fortune file, you should copy both the fortune file and the DAT file to the `/usr/share/games/fortune/` directory.

Most distros like to include lots of extra files.  If this is the only one you want, delete those first.

Once installed, run `fortune` on the command-line to be sure it's working.

What most people do with fortune is place the command `fortune` in their `.bashrc` file so that new terminals print a nice little quote every time you start a terminal session.
